# Bartłomiej Kozal

I have over 15 years of experience in software engineering and graphic design. I like climbing, drawing, playing piano, board games, graphic novels, and books. Read more about me at [bartkozal.com](https://bartkozal.com/).

### Software Engineering

I started in C++ then professionally focused on **Ruby**, **Swift**, and **JavaScript**. Through all the years **I worked on games, web applications, native, and mobile apps**. I have experience working for **startups, scaleups, and large companies** in technologies like: _JavaScript_, _TypeScript_, _Node.js_, _React_, _React Native_, _Electron_, _Next.js_, _Vue.js_, _AngularJS_, _Ember.js_, _GraphQL_, _Swift_, _Objective-C_, _Ruby_, _Ruby on Rails_, _PostgreSQL_, _MongoDB_, _MySQL_, _Elasticsearch_, _Redis_, _RealmDB_, _Docker_.

I developed **over 30 open source libraries** in various technologies and contributed to projects like _Rails_ and _ycmd_. My most popular repositories are:
1. [Float label pattern](https://github.com/bartkozal/vue-float-label) (vue-float-label)
2. [Universal and lightweight stylesheet starter kit](https://github.com/bartkozal/hocus-pocus) (hocus-pocus)
3. [Text-editor-like weekly planner](https://github.com/bartkozal/coypu) (coypu)
4. [Flexbox based responsive fraction grid system](https://github.com/bartkozal/vue-fraction-grid) (vue-fraction-grid)

### Product Development

Between 2012 and 2016 I was a core team member and then **the CEO of a startup**. [Shelly Cloud](https://shellycloud.com/) was an automated hosting platform that made deploying Ruby applications painless. We hosted **over 270 paying applications on 430 virtual servers**. I worked in all areas required to build and run a successful product: user experience, front-end and back-end development, server administration, support, marketing, sales, and team management.

I was a solopreneur for over a year and created a few indie products. One of them was promoted by Apple in the AppStore and **reached over 130.000 users**. Now they are all open-sourced. You can find them here:

### Drawing, Graphic Design & Animation

I enjoy spending my free time pencil drawing. I know how to use all popular graphic software including 3D software like Blender. I self-studied **character design and animation**. I was also working on **procedurally generated graphic and physics simulations**. I participate in drawing challenges like Inktober.
