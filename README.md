### Software Engineering

I started in C++ then professionally focused on Ruby, Swift, and JavaScript. Through all the years **I worked on games, web applications, native, and mobile apps**. I have experience working for startups, scaleups, and large companies in technologies like: JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, React Native, Electron, Next.js, Vue.js, AngularJS, Ember.js, GraphQL, Swift, Objective-C, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, RealmDB, Docker

I developed **over 30 open source libraries** in various technologies and contributed to projects like Rails and ycmd.

### Product Development

Between 2012 and 2016 I was a core team member and then **the CEO of a startup**. Shelly Cloud was an automated hosting platform that made the deployment of Ruby applications painless. We hosted **over 270 paying applications on 430 virtual servers**. I worked in all areas required to built and run a successful product: user experience, front-end and back-end development, server administration, support, marketing, sales, and team management.

For over a year I was a solopreneur and created few indie products. One of them was promoted by Apple in the AppStore and **reached over 130.000 users**. Now they are all open-sourced.

### Drawing, Graphic Design & Animation

I enjoy spending my free time pencil drawing. I know how to use all popular graphic software including 3D software like Blender. I was self-studying **character design and animation**. I was also working on **procedurally generated graphic and physics simulations**. I participate in drawing challenges like Inktober.

### Music

I like playing piano. In 2021 I started attending **jazz piano lessons and studying music theory**. I know how to use DAW software. I designed sound for my animations.

### Other

My other hobbies besides coding, drawing, and playing jazz are: **climbing, board games, graphic novels, and books**.
